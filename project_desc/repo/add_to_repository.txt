Input / Output: Input: { roomId: string } from client / Output: Emits 'gameStarted' or 'error' to client

File: src/services/socketService.ts
Function: joinRoom
Short description: Reverted to a void function that only emits the 'joinRoom' event. Promise logic and timeout removed to simplify and rely on gameStore's event listener.
Input / Output: Input: roomId: string, password?: string / Output: void

File: src/stores/gameStore.ts
Function: joinRoom (Action)
Short description: Reverted to a void action that calls socketService.joinRoom. Async/await and try/catch removed.

File: src/stores/gameStore.ts
Function: (onRoomJoined event handler)
Short description: Added checks to validate the received 'room' object and its 'players' property before updating the state. Added more detailed error logging for invalid data.
Input / Output: Input: room: Room (from server event) / Output: Updates store state

File: src/pages/JoinRoomPage.tsx
Function: (React Component)
Short description: Modified to display a loading message until the player is registered (currentPlayer exists in gameStore) before showing the RoomList. Removed handleJoinSuccess and onJoinSuccess prop.
Input / Output: N/A (Component rendering logic)

File: src/components/room/RoomList.tsx
Function: handleJoinRoom

Input / Output: Input: e: React.FormEvent / Output: void (Calls joinRoom action)

File: server/src/server.ts
Function: (Socket.IO 'joinRoom' event handler)
Short description: Modified to send the room object directly in the 'roomJoined' event payload, instead of nesting it within another object. This fixes an issue where the client received invalid data. Also added logic to send the current game state via 'gameStateUpdated' if the player joins an ongoing game.
Input / Output: Input: { roomId: string, password?: string } from client / Output: Emits 'roomJoined', 'gameStateUpdated' (if applicable), or 'error' to client

File: server/src/services/gameManager.ts
Class: GameManager

File: server/src/services/gameManager.ts
Class: GameManager
Function: (Multiple methods)
Short description: Modified GameManager to extend EventEmitter and emit 'gameStateUpdated' events whenever the game state changes (e.g., phase change, timer update, move, declaration, score update, game end).
Input / Output: N/A (Internal event emission)

File: server/src/server.ts
Function: (Socket.IO 'createRoom' event handler)
Short description: Added an event listener for the 'gameStateUpdated' event emitted by the GameManager instance. When the event is received, the updated game state is broadcasted to all clients in the corresponding room using the 'gameStateUpdated' socket event.
Input / Output: N/A (Listens for internal events and emits socket events)
