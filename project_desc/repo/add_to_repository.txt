### server/src/types/game.ts

* Short description: Defines TypeScript types for multiplayer game state management.
* Key types:
  - GamePhase: Enum for game phases (waiting, declaration, solution, finished)
  - Position: Interface for robot positions (x, y coordinates)
  - RobotColor: Enum for robot colors (red, blue, green, yellow)
  - Card: Interface for game cards (color, symbol, position)
  - Declaration: Interface for move declarations
  - PlayerGameState: Interface for player-specific game state
  - MultiplayerGameState: Interface for overall game state
  - GameRules: Interface for game configuration
  - DEFAULT_GAME_RULES: Constant with default game rules

### server/src/services/gameManager.ts

* GameManager (Class)
  * constructor
    * short description: Initializes game manager with players and rules
    * input / output: Takes `players: Player[]`, `rules: GameRules`. Returns `void`.
  * startGame
    * short description: Starts the game if enough players are present
    * input / output: Takes no input. Returns `void`. Throws if game already started or too few players.
  * declareMoves
    * short description: Handles player's move count declarations
    * input / output: Takes `playerId: string`, `moves: number`. Returns `void`. Throws if invalid phase or moves.
  * moveRobot
    * short description: Handles robot movement during solution phase
    * input / output: Takes `playerId: string`, `robotColor: RobotColor`, `positions: Position[]`. Returns `void`.
  * getGameState
    * short description: Returns current game state
    * input / output: Takes no input. Returns `MultiplayerGameState`.

### server/src/services/__tests__/gameManager.test.ts

* Short description: Contains comprehensive tests for GameManager class.
* Test suites:
  - Game Initialization: Tests game setup and starting conditions
  - Declaration Phase: Tests move declaration validation and timing
  - Solution Phase: Tests robot movement validation and player turns
  - Game End: Tests game completion conditions

Implementation Details
================================================================

### Multiplayer Game Logic
- Game state management using GameManager class
- Phase-based gameplay (waiting → declaration → solution)
- Timer system for declaration and solution phases
- Move validation and scoring system
- Player turn management

### Game Flow
1. Game starts with 2+ players
2. Players declare move counts (1-30 moves)
3. Lowest declarer attempts solution
4. Success: +1 point, new card
5. Failure: -1 point, next lowest declarer tries
6. Game ends when all cards are used

### Testing
- Unit tests cover all major functionality
- Mock timers for testing time-dependent features
- Edge cases tested (invalid moves, timeouts)
- Player interaction scenarios verified

TODO:
1. Card deck implementation
2. Goal achievement validation logic
3. Integration with Socket.IO events
